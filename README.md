# Surface Flux Transport (SFT) modelling using Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)

This repository contains code to solve the surface flux transport (SFT) equation using numerical and machine-learning approaches.
The equation is addressed in both azimuthally averaged (1D) and 2D contexts.

The repository includes four files:

1. 1D_numerical.py  (Explicit and RK-IMEX)
2. 1D_PINNs.py
3. 2D_numerical.py  (Explicit and RK-IMEX)
4. 2D_PINNs.py

## Requirements

To get started with this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

- [DeepXDE](https://deepxde.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/installation.html)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
